<Title>Offline Improvements + Confidential Testing / Avoiding Accidental Result Uploads</Title>
</head>

<h1>Offline Enhancement Via Local Cache</h1>
<p>Beginning with Phoronix Test Suite 9.0, there are improvements to improve the out-of-the-box experience if running the Phoronix Test Suite in a strictly offline environment / behind-the-firewall without access to OpenBenchmarking.org for being able to obtain test profiles / test suites. From Phoronix Test Suite 3.0 when OpenBenchmarking.org was introduced until Phoronix Test Suite 9.0, Internet connectivity was initially required for obtaining the test profiles/suites as the cloud/repository. OpenBenchmarking.org allows for tests to be updated independently of the Phoronix Test Suite releases as well as allowing new tests to be introduced on-demand. Aside from when new tests require explicit new PTS features, this allows tests/suites to be seamlessly used by older versions of the Phoronix Test Suite without any upgrade process required, assuming Internet connectivity is available.</p>
<p>Beginning with Phoronix Test Suite 9.0, a static snapshot of the official tests/suites is included as part of the Phoronix Test Suite package. The intention with this is to provide a static snapshot with all tests/suites as of release time, similar to the behavior with pre-3.0 releases. The benefit to including this static snapshot is helping those that are running strictly offline/isolated to be able to have at least recent tests/suites available without first needing to query OpenBenchmarking.org for this data. But Internet support is certainly desired in order to be able to obtain updated and new test profiles.</p>
<p>This static snapshot is provided in the <em>ob-cache/</em> Phoronix Test Suite folder. If this cache is not needed or wish to customize/extend it, it can be safely removed and or altered without causing issues. When the Phoronix Test Suite has Internet connectivity, it will continue to query OpenBenchmarking.org for new/updated tests and suites.</p>
<p>This local cache does provide current and previous versions of test profiles to allow users to continue running older versions of tests/results even when upgrading their Phoronix Test Suite offline copy.</p>
<p>Even with the local cache, there still is the need for obtaining any necessary files needed to run the selected test(s). For those wishing to optimize that workflow for offline usage, see the existing <em>phoronix-test-suite make-download-cache</em> sub-command documentation. The <em>phoronix-test-suite make-openbenchmarking-cache</em> sub-command may also be desirable depending upon setup.</p>
<h1>Disabling OpenBenchmarking.org Result Upload Functionality</h1>
<p>Phoronix Test Suite 9.0 also improved the workflow around disabling OpenBenchmarking.org result uploading functionality for those carrying out confidential tests or otherwise wish to provide safeguards for ensuring no results may be accidentally uploaded publicly.</p>
<p>Removal of OpenBenchmarking.org upload support can be done by deleting <em>phoronix-test-suite/pts-core/objects/pts_openbenchmarking_upload.php</em>. If that file is removed, the Phoronix Test Suite should respond gracefully and not prompt users about any upload and within that file is the only logic for actually uploading the results to Openbenchmarking. So simply by removing that file you should be covered from any accidental uploading of results. Removal/disabling of this file also prevents any anonymous usage reporting.</p>
<p>For those without the ability to remove that file from their Phoronix Test Suite installation or as a secondary safeguard, from the Phoronix Test Suite user configuration file (<em>/etc/phoronix-test-suite.xml<em> as root or <em>~/.phoronix-test-suite/user-config.xml<em> for most users) is a "<em>AllowResultUploadsToOpenBenchmarking</em>" option. If setting that value to <em>FALSE</em>, it should apply the same behavior as if deleting the pts_openbenchmarking_upload file.</p>
<p>If distributing a customized/local copy of the Phoronix Test Suite, the default behavior of the configuration file (in addition to deleting the pts_openbenchmarking_upload file) can be done via the user configuration defaults defined within <em>pts-core/static/user-config-defaults.xml</em>.</p>
