<h2>Download Cache For Tests</h2>
<p>If you are a company or simply own multiple computers, the download caching support of the Phoronix Test Suite can work quite well. This feature allows you to very simply setup a local (or network-wide) repository for the Phoronix Test Suite of all the files the different tests use. After you have installed the tests on one system that you normally use (or have ran <em>phoronix-test-suite install all</em>) running <em>phoronix-test-suite make-download-cache</em> will cache all of the files that each test downloaded. The location of this cache is <em>~/.phoronix-test-suite/download-cache/</em>.</p>
<p>Once the cache has been created, you can copy this folder to other systems and place the files in the same location. Then when the Phoronix Test Suite needs to download a file for a test, before downloading it from the Internet it will first check this cache for the file(s). If the files are there and the MD5 check-sums have been verified, it will simply copy the file -- thereby saving bandwidth and time. The download cache location can be downloaded in <em>~/.phoronix-test-suite/user-config.xml</em>. By adjusting the download cache, you could setup the cache folder to be on an FTP or NFS share (as an example) on a server that's accessible via your LAN. Configure your test systems to use this local repository and you will be saving time and bandwidth.</p>
