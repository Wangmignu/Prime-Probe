The files in this directory are optional, providing a static cache of test profiles / test suites available via OpenBenchmarking.org.

Patches to this directory will not be accepted but test profile changes should be submitted via https://github.com/phoronix-test-suite/test-profiles/

This "ob-cache" is intended to help those running the Phoronix Test Suite behind firewalls / offline where they may not be able to query OpenBenchmarking.org for obtaining test data.
